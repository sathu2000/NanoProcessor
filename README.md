# NanoProcessor
In this project we were designed a simple 4-bit microprocessor which is capable of executing a set of simple instructions.

To build this circuit we had designed the internal structure of these necessary sub components and simulated each component. Finally we had assembled them and built the Nano processor circuit.
4-bit Add/Subtract unit
3-bit adder
3-bit Program Counter (PC)
k-way b-bit multiplexers 
Register Bank
Program ROM
Instruction Decoder
Buses
We had written an Assembly program to calculate the total of all integers between 1 and 3 using the instructions in the given instructions set and convert the assembly code to machine code and hardcode it to ROM.
we had checked the functionality of whole circuit via simulation
